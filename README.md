# cs61a_scheme

An implementation of [61A Scheme][spec] in Dart, designed for use both in the
Dart VM and on the web.

This implementation is **not** complete. You must implement
`ProjectInterface` (in `lib/src/core/project_interface.dart`). You can skip
implementing certain optional pieces of the interpreter by adding the other
classes in that file as mixins.
